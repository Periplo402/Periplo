# TOOLING.md

Operational notes for whoever edits this repo with Claude Code: exact
commands, local environment quirks, and machine-specific setup. None of
this is architecture or a design decision, it's how to run things on this
machine. See [`CLAUDE.md`](../CLAUDE.md) for what the project is and why
it's built the way it is, and [`docs/DEFERRED.md`](DEFERRED.md) for
divergences between what `docs/SPEC.md` assumes about the environment and
what's actually here.

## Commands

Requires Node ≥22. `pnpm@11.22.0` (pinned via `package.json`'s
`packageManager` field) will not run on Node <22.13, it
imports the `node:sqlite` built-in. This machine's default shell Node is
20.19.6; switch first in every new shell:

```bash
export NVM_DIR="$HOME/.nvm"; . "$NVM_DIR/nvm.sh"; nvm use 22
```

(`.nvmrc` pins `22`, but this harness starts a fresh non-login shell per
tool call, so nvm's automatic `.nvmrc` pickup doesn't persist between
commands, run the line above each time.)

```bash
pnpm install
pnpm typecheck        # tsc -b across all workspace packages (project references)
pnpm lint              # biome check .
pnpm lint:fix           # biome check --write .
pnpm test               # vitest run, workspace-wide
pnpm test:watch
pnpm licence-check      # AGPL/copyleft gate, see CLAUDE.md's non-negotiable constraints
pnpm audit --prod       # dependency advisory gate, production graph only (spec §6/§7)
pnpm run ci             # typecheck && lint && test && licence-check && audit --prod, in that order
```

**Use `pnpm run ci`, not bare `pnpm ci`.** `ci` is a reserved pnpm CLI
command (alias for `clean-install`: `pnpm clean` + `pnpm install
--frozen-lockfile`) that shadows a package.json script of the same name;
bare `pnpm ci` silently reinstalls dependencies instead of running the
gate, with no error pointing at the shadowing. `pnpm run ci` forces
package.json script resolution. Found empirically running this exact
command during Phase 4 (`pnpm help ci` confirms the alias); every
individual step (`typecheck`/`lint`/`test`/`licence-check`) was still run
and verified separately throughout Phases 0-3, so this was a misleading
shortcut, not a gap in what actually got checked.

One advisory (`GHSA-mrhx-c7xc-m3w5`, zod) is ignored on purpose via
`pnpm-workspace.yaml`'s `auditConfig.ignoreGhsas`; see the comment above
that entry for why forcing a fix would be worse than the advisory as
scoped to this repo's actual dependency paths.

Run a single test file: `pnpm exec vitest run path/to/file.test.ts`.

## Running the real integration suites locally

CI runs the Supabase suites and `pnpm eval` against a throwaway local
stack, and so should you. With Docker and the Supabase CLI installed, run
`supabase start` from the repo root (it applies `supabase/migrations/`),
then put the values `supabase status` prints for the API URL, anon key and
service-role key into `SUPABASE_URL`, `SUPABASE_ANON_KEY` and
`SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY` in your local, gitignored `.env`. Run
`export NVM_DIR="$HOME/.nvm"; . "$NVM_DIR/nvm.sh"; nvm use 22` then
`pnpm test` and `pnpm eval`.

The suites and `pnpm eval` insert and delete rows, so they refuse a
`SUPABASE_URL` that is not a loopback address
(`packages/bazaar/src/db/local-only.ts`). With the production project's URL
in `.env`, `pnpm test` fails with `RemoteSupabaseRefusedError` instead of
writing to the live catalog. To run against a remote project on purpose,
set `PERIPLO_ALLOW_REMOTE_SUPABASE_TESTS=1`; the manual `prod-parity`
workflow (Actions tab, "Run workflow") does exactly that for the RLS suite
and is the only automated job that writes to the real project.

`apps/facilitator/src/core.test.ts` needs the testnet fee-sponsor
credentials (`STELLAR_FEE_SPONSOR_SECRET`, `STELLAR_FEE_SPONSOR_PUBLIC`, a
read-only account check), kept in `.env` and in the repo's GitHub Actions
secrets, never in a committed file. Without them it fails at collection
rather than skipping, see `docs/DEFERRED.md`.

Real Stellar testnet test fixtures also exist for exercising a live
payment, not just `PTEST` (the self-issued token from Phase 3, since
Circle's faucet has no API): `STELLAR_TEST_BUYER_PUBLIC` now also holds
real testnet USDC with an established trustline
(`GBBD47IF6LWK7P7MDEVSCWR7DPUWV3NY3DTQEVFL4NAT4AQH3ZLLFLA5` is the real
issuer, read authoritatively off the SAC contract's own `name()` call,
not guessed). `apps/facilitator/scripts/settle-demo.ts` can target either
asset by env var.

## Redeploying apps/facilitator on Fly.io

Redeploy with
`fly deploy --config fly.facilitator.toml --dockerfile Dockerfile.facilitator -a periplo-testnet`
from the repo root; secrets are set via `fly secrets set -a periplo-testnet`,
never in `fly.facilitator.toml`. **The app lives under the Fly account that
owns it, not whatever account a given `fly` CLI session happens to be
logged into**: a session authenticated as a
different account gets `Error: unauthorized` on deploy and can't even see
`periplo-testnet` in `fly apps list`, found live, not assumed, when a
redeploy failed this way and was only fixed by switching accounts
(`docs/DEFERRED.md`). Verify with `fly auth whoami` /
`fly apps list` before assuming a deploy will work.

## Checking CI

`.github/workflows/ci.yml` silently failed to run at all from Phase 1
through Phase 3 (two stacked, independently-diagnosed causes: a malformed
reusable-workflow reference, then a private-repo Actions-minutes billing
block once that was fixed; full evidence in `docs/DEFERRED.md`), while
every phase's local `pnpm ci` was genuinely green the whole time. Check
`gh run list -R Eras256/Periplo` periodically; CI passing locally is not
the same claim as CI passing, don't assume CI mirrors the local gate.

## Environment notes specific to this machine

- `docs/DEFERRED.md` tracks every divergence found between what
  `docs/SPEC.md` assumes about the environment (tool versions, MCP server
  availability, skill pack contents) and what's actually here, plus how
  each was resolved. Check it before assuming a tool or credential isn't
  available, several things that looked missing on first inspection
  turned out to just need a different check (e.g. the `stellar-build`
  skill pack: `ls ~/.claude/skills/` undercounts it, invoke skills by name
  via the `Skill` tool instead of trusting that directory listing).
- `docs/SKILLS.md` maps which `stellar-build` skills actually exist in this
  environment to the phases in `docs/SPEC.md`.
- `docs/ECOSYSTEM.md` is a partial, dated snapshot of the competitive
  landscape (LumenLoop catalogue) used for differentiation framing, not
  live data, regenerate before relying on it for the actual submission.
- `docs/MEMORY.md` is the running, committed decision log for *why* things
  were built the way they were, append to it at every phase, alongside
  `docs/DEFERRED.md` for what wasn't built.
- An OpenAI Codex config exists at `~/.codex/config.toml` on this machine
  (user-level, not project-level). Not read or imported; if useful here,
  run `/import` interactively to review what it would bring in.
