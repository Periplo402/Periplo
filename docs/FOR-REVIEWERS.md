# For reviewers: a 10-minute path through this repo

`CLAUDE.md` is written for a Claude Code session to resume work; it
assumes you already know the project. This file assumes the opposite:
you're a panel reviewer with 20+ submissions to get through and ten
minutes for this one. Read in this order.

## 1. Click something real first (30 seconds)

[`https://periplo-testnet.fly.dev`](https://periplo-testnet.fly.dev) is
live right now, `stellar:testnet`. `GET /supported` returns the real
`exact` scheme capabilities; `GET /discovery/resources` returns the real
Bazaar catalog. Nothing below this line needs to be taken on faith,
you can check it yourself before reading another word.

## 2. The one thing no other submission in this round can currently show (2 minutes)

Two adjacent implementations in this same SCF #45 round chose to build on the
`upto` payment spec this project opened upstream, rather than fork their
own: [Rialto's design was incorporated into the same spec document](https://github.com/x402-foundation/x402/pull/3134),
and [AutoLayer stated on the thread](https://github.com/x402-foundation/x402/pull/3098)
that it "will not open a third competing spec PR." (That is a change inside
our PR, not an upstream merge: `#3098` and `#3134` are both still open
against `x402-foundation/x402`, `merged: false` as of 2026-09-27.) Read
[the "ecosystem is converging" section of README.md](../README.md#the-ecosystem-is-converging-on-this-spec-not-the-other-way-around)
or the full [`docs/UPTO-CONVERGENCE.md`](UPTO-CONVERGENCE.md) devlog for
the sourced, dated version.

## 3. A gap the ecosystem itself didn't see (1 minute)

Section 2 is two adjacent implementations building on this project's spec. This is
one step further: both that spec and the competing one claim Stellar
smart accounts (C-accounts) work "transparently" with the mechanism
`upto` depends on. That claim holds only for a C-account that signs
directly. It does not hold, as far as anyone has publicly shown, for a
delegated or session-key smart-account signer, the exact pattern an
autonomous agent needs. This project tried to build that in Phase 6b
and hit a real wall: `__check_auth` traps on every construction tried,
filed at
[OpenZeppelin/stellar-contracts#839](https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/stellar-contracts/issues/839).
That issue was root-caused and closed 2026-09-02 (an SDK auth-discovery
gap, not a contract bug), and a real `Signer::Delegated` smart-account
authorization has since settled on testnet for a single-context call
([`428021a6…`](https://stellar.expert/explorer/testnet/tx/428021a6ef648937bf0edeec96d42f13e44447eac9b036c127c90cf4bebdd71b)).
The full two-context `upto` settle path through the delegated account
is still open. [The rewritten spec PR](https://github.com/x402-foundation/x402/pull/3098)
states the caveat plainly rather than let the gap ship silently.
`gh api repos/Eras256/x402/commits/6a528a5a` returns the same
`verified: true` any commit in this repo does; check it, don't take it
on trust. Full writeup in
[`docs/UPTO-CONVERGENCE.md`](UPTO-CONVERGENCE.md#the-structure-actually-drafted-five-days-later-and-a-new-finding).

## 4. A second, different gap: settlement, not authentication (1 minute)

Same day, same underlying skill, a different finding. `batch-settlement`
(deposit once, sign vouchers off-chain, redeem rarely) has no Stellar
binding upstream yet, and its design needs voucher signatures with no
real expiry, exactly what EVM's and SVM's existing bindings both give
it. `require_auth_for_args`, the mechanism `upto` depends on, cannot:
the Soroban host hard-rejects any signed authorization expiring more
than 180 days out, checked directly against real testnet
(`state_archival.max_entry_ttl`), not assumed from a rough guess. Filed
at [x402-foundation/x402#3341](https://github.com/x402-foundation/x402/issues/3341)
with a real, precedented alternative sketched (raw Ed25519 verification,
already Stellar's own reference pattern), not a promise to build it.
Reinforced since with a real precedent from Stellar Foundation itself
(the MPP Channel mode contract), see
[`docs/UPTO-CONVERGENCE.md`](UPTO-CONVERGENCE.md#the-structure-actually-drafted-five-days-later-and-a-new-finding).
Full writeup in
[`docs/SPEC.md`](SPEC.md#phase-6-upto-on-stellar).

## 5. A maintainer engaged, and every point got fixed with evidence (1 minute)

Filing bugs is one kind of evidence: real problems, found and reported.
This is the other kind: a Stellar SDK maintainer engaging directly and a
same-day, verifiable response. On 2026-09-01, Ryang-21 left a formal
`CHANGES_REQUESTED` review on
[stellar/js-stellar-sdk#1672](https://github.com/stellar/js-stellar-sdk/pull/1672)
(the PR behind the CAP-71 delegate-signing bug filed above), five inline
comments, each a genuine silent-signature-corruption risk on the new
code path, not a style nit. All five fixed the same day in one commit,
each with its own new regression test verified against real signing
rather than a passthrough mock (a bug in the test itself, caught before
it was pushed, not shipped). Replied inline to each point with the fix
and evidence, not a bare "done."
`gh api repos/Eras256/js-stellar-sdk/commits/81466fd9 --jq
'.commit.verification.verified'` returns `true` for the resulting,
signed merge commit; check it, don't take it on trust. CI shows
`action_required`, GitHub's standard gate for an external PR awaiting a
maintainer's approval to run workflows, not a failure on this branch.
Full detail in `README.md`'s #1672 history.

**Update, 2026-09-26 (checked against the GitHub API that day):** #1672 was
closed without merging, in favor of the maintainer's own
[#1747](https://github.com/stellar/js-stellar-sdk/pull/1747), which
`Closes #1655` (approved 2026-09-24, not yet merged as of this update). The
signature check above describes the state of the branch on 2026-09-01.

**Update, 2026-10-02 (checked against the GitHub API that day):** #1747
merged on 2026-09-28 and closed #1655 as completed. It shipped in
[v17.2.0](https://github.com/stellar/js-stellar-sdk/releases/tag/v17.2.0) (2026-09-28), as did
[#1742](https://github.com/stellar/js-stellar-sdk/pull/1742),
[#1743](https://github.com/stellar/js-stellar-sdk/pull/1743),
[#1744](https://github.com/stellar/js-stellar-sdk/pull/1744) and
[#1745](https://github.com/stellar/js-stellar-sdk/pull/1745); the latest
release is now [v17.2.1](https://github.com/stellar/js-stellar-sdk/releases/tag/v17.2.1) (2026-10-01). This supersedes "not yet merged"
above.

The same defect class recurred the same day in a different official SDK:
`StellarCN/py-stellar-base`'s `authorize_entry()` silently invalidates an
earlier CAP-71 delegate's signature when a later delegate signs with a
different expiration, reproduced for real (not just read) against the
published source and filed as
[StellarCN/py-stellar-base#1215](https://github.com/StellarCN/py-stellar-base/issues/1215)
with a proposed fix. Two independent SDKs, two independent teams,
the same subtle mistake, caught by the same underlying expertise this
project built fixing it the first time.

## 6. A real, external seller already uses this (1 minute)

Section 2 is design-level alignment between competing teams. This is
adoption: [`agentpayments.fi`](https://agentpayments.fi) built its own
resource server, pointed it at this facilitator with no coordination
beyond following [`docs/SELLERS.md`](SELLERS.md), and settled a real
payment, real testnet USDC, from a buyer that isn't this project either.
Try it yourself:
[`GET /discovery/search?query=conformance`](https://periplo-testnet.fly.dev/discovery/search?query=conformance)
returns their resource as the top result, found by a stranger, not
inserted by us. The settled transaction
([`4befe51d2c1e...`](https://stellar.expert/explorer/testnet/tx/4befe51d2c1e58387d128c2f759262d33454b209f2aee8a03283a85b027904fd))
is the row `conformance/RESULTS.md` itself marks as the strongest
evidence in that document, ahead of every transaction this project
settled with its own test accounts.

That same integration found a real bug in the official client itself:
`HTTPFacilitatorClient` discarded the `EXTENSION-RESPONSES` header
instead of returning it, filed as
[x402-foundation/x402#3270](https://github.com/x402-foundation/x402/issues/3270),
closed 2026-08-31 by a maintainer's own fix
([`#3306`](https://github.com/x402-foundation/x402/pull/3306)), not the
community PRs originally tracking it. Periplo's own `/settle` still
uses the field shape that fix moved away from; migrating is tracked in
`docs/DEFERRED.md`, not urgent since no `@x402/core` release requires
it yet. Full detail in `README.md`, the block starting "The first real
external seller published and settled for real."

## 7. The evidence table (2 minutes)

[`conformance/RESULTS.md`](../conformance/RESULTS.md) lists every settled
transaction this project claims, each with a transaction hash checked
against Horizon independently, not just printed by the script that made
it. This is the standard applied to every capability claim in this repo:
a link, a test, or a hash, never a bare assertion. `README.md`'s "What's
real right now" section follows the same rule and is explicit about what
is planned but not yet built.

## 8. What's actually deployed vs. what's still a plan (2 minutes)

`README.md`'s opening section states the phase status plainly: "Status:
Phase 6, the `upto` Soroban contract, is complete... The rest of Phase
10 is not done." That's a broader claim than "nothing since Phase 6":
Phase 6b (additional evidence beyond the Phase 6 gate, not a tranche
deliverable), the `upto` HTTP-route wiring, the official x402
conformance-suite run, and the live demo resource all happened after
Phase 6 and are documented in this same README and in
[`conformance/RESULTS.md`](../conformance/RESULTS.md). What genuinely
hasn't started is Phase 7 (the MCP discovery server, per `CLAUDE.md`'s
status line) and Phase 9, the developer hub; the
README says so outright for the frontend. If you want the honest,
itemized list of every deferred piece and every environment-specific
gotcha encountered along the way, that's
[`docs/DEFERRED.md`](DEFERRED.md), the project's own running log of
blockers and divergences, not a curated highlight reel.

## 9. Security, if that's your focus (2 minutes)

[`docs/THREAT-MODEL.md`](THREAT-MODEL.md) is the threat/control/test
table, each row pointing at the actual code and test file that backs it,
including the one honest gap (no CI-enforced secret-leakage check yet)
stated rather than hidden. Third-party review has not happened yet: see
that file's own status note, and [`docs/DEFERRED.md`](DEFERRED.md)'s
"Third-party security review: pending via Audit Bank" section for
exactly where that stands.

## 10. If you want the full architecture

[`docs/ARCHITECTURE.md`](ARCHITECTURE.md) has the system diagram and a
plain-English walk-through of the stack. [`docs/SPEC.md`](SPEC.md) is the
full, phased build specification everything above is built against, for
when ten minutes becomes an hour.

## 11. If you scored against the RFP listing directly

[`docs/RFP-COMPLIANCE.md`](RFP-COMPLIANCE.md) quotes every requirement
and evaluation criterion from the SCF Handbook's RFP Track page and the
"X402 Facilitator with Bazaar" listing, one row per requirement, mapped
to real evidence, with the genuinely open items named rather than
implied covered.
