# Upstream GitHub state check

Periplo's SCF evidence depends on ~40 cited GitHub issues/PRs staying
accurate: its own filed bugs, its fix PRs, the `upto` spec-convergence
threads, and the Phase 6b `agent-smart-account` blockers. The submission
is locked; a reviewer clicking a stale link on a future date is the only
lever left, so the cited state has to be re-verified, not assumed.

`packages/evidence-check` already runs the *mechanical* half on every
push (every cited tx hash still `successful: true` on Horizon, every
cited issue/PR link still resolves, every internal doc link still on
disk, `GET /supported` still live). This skill is the *narrative* half
it can't do: what changed in status, comments, and merge mechanics since
the last sweep, and what that means.

## 1. Derive the tracked list (never hand-maintain it)

The list of tracked items is exactly the GitHub issue/PR links cited in
the repo's own evidence docs. Re-derive it every run:

```bash
grep -rhoE 'https://github\.com/[A-Za-z0-9._-]+/[A-Za-z0-9._-]+/(issues|pull)/[0-9]+' \
  README.md docs/DEFERRED.md docs/UPTO-CONVERGENCE.md conformance/RESULTS.md CLAUDE.md \
  | sed 's#https://github.com/##' | sort -u
```

Add the four convergence anchors if not already present: `#3097`
(the `upto` issue), `stellar/x402-stellar#72`, plus whatever
`docs/UPTO-CONVERGENCE.md`'s tail section is currently pointing at.

## 2. Find the last recorded check

- `git log --oneline -- docs/DEFERRED.md | grep -i "github state\|state check"`
  finds the prior sweep commit (e.g. `a3a9571`, 2026-09-07).
- The memory file `periplo-post-submission-status.md` carries a dated
  entry per sweep; read its most recent one for the baseline.
- **Use the exact timestamp, not the calendar date.** The right cutoff
  is the latest `updated_at`/comment timestamp the prior sweep actually
  saw and recorded (e.g. `2026-09-11T18:26:07Z`), not "2026-09-11" or
  "2026-09-13". A same-day-but-later comment sits past that exact
  instant even though it shares a calendar date with the sweep that
  missed it: the 2026-09-13 sweep reported "nothing new" using
  date-level reasoning, then two comments from 14:24-14:29 UTC that
  same day (`#840`, `x402-foundation/x402#3138`) surfaced only on the
  next sweep. Compare every `updated_at` against the recorded timestamp
  with a strict `>`, never a date-only comparison.

## 3. Fetch live state, one batch

```bash
gh api "repos/<owner>/<repo>/issues/<n>" --jq \
 '"\(.state) \(.state_reason // "") merged=\(.pull_request.merged_at // "no") | \(.title) | updated=\(.updated_at)"'
```

Loop it over the derived list (see the shape in `a3a9571`'s own working
notes if still in scratch, or just re-write the loop). Then:

- Sort by `updated_at`. Anything after the last-check date gets a real
  look: `gh issue view <n> --repo <r> --comments`,
  `gh pr view <n> --repo <r> --json state,mergedAt,reviewDecision,mergeStateStatus,statusCheckRollup`.
- For Periplo's own open fix PRs, check CI (`statusCheckRollup`) and
  `reviewDecision` / `mergeStateStatus`. A green PR sitting `BLOCKED` /
  `REVIEW_REQUIRED` is waiting on a maintainer. Record how long it's
  been waiting and a nudge threshold (~2 weeks), don't nudge early.

## 4. Investigate what moved: the lessons that keep recurring

- **"Resolved upstream" / "closed" is a prompt to read the actual merge
  mechanism, not just the open/closed bit.** `#3270` was closed by a
  maintainer's own PR (`#3306`) that *rejected* the community PRs' field
  shape; `#1215` was closed by a maintainer's own PR (`#1218`) that
  *matched* the proposed fix. Same "closed completed", opposite meaning
  for what Periplo's code should do next. Read the closing PR's diff.
- **A finding can turn out wrong.** `#840` (fee-abstraction) got a
  complete, sound rebuttal from brozorec after the counter-example; the
  right move was to correct `DEFERRED.md` from "not resolved either way"
  to "resolved and wrong, do not reopen", not to keep it as an open
  grievance. When a maintainer's explanation holds, say so plainly.
- **`author: Eras256` does not mean Periplo.** The identity is shared
  with other projects; `#3171` and `stellar-dev-skill#96`/`#97`
  are not Periplo's. The user's own tracking board is the authority: ask,
  don't infer from the author field or a local checkout path.
- **Local `git log` is not `origin`, and a prior read is not the
  source.** `git fetch` and compare against `origin/main` before
  reporting a commit as pushed; re-fetch any issue/PR the same turn
  before citing it, even if read earlier in the session.
- **Convergence threads are traction evidence, not just status.** When a
  third party cites `#3098` as a spec base or credits a section to
  `@Eras256`/`@HeylmStoned` (e.g. `#3428` section 7.5), that belongs in
  README's top-of-file convergence section and `docs/UPTO-CONVERGENCE.md`
  as a dated entry, framed as adoption, not a passing mention. Verify
  the credit against the real PR body first.

## 5. Write it up

- **Substantive changes** (a fix merged, a finding resolved, a new
  citation) each get their own targeted commit editing the specific doc
  that carried the stale claim: `docs/DEFERRED.md` for findings,
  `README.md` + `docs/UPTO-CONVERGENCE.md` for convergence, and
  `CLAUDE.md`'s Phase 6b section where it names the item.
- **The sweep itself** gets a dated entry appended to the memory file
  `periplo-post-submission-status.md` (not a repo doc unless the
  2026-09-07 `a3a9571` pattern of a small `DEFERRED.md` note is wanted):
  what was checked, what changed with commit hashes, forward-looking
  watch-items with dates, and one line confirming everything else
  unchanged.
- **Em-dash discipline** applies to every doc edit: rewrite per sentence
  (comma / period / colon), never a find-and-replace, never introduce a
  a literal em dash. Verbatim reviewer quotes (whawk46's) keep their
  original em dashes on purpose. Check added lines:
  `git diff | grep '^+' | grep -c $'\xe2\x80\x94'` must be `0`.
- **Work in an isolated worktree, never `~/Periplo` directly** (several
  sessions can share that checkout at once): `git worktree add -b
  <branch> <scratchpad>/<name> origin/main`, make every edit and commit
  there.
- **Commit + PR, never a direct push to `main`.** Confirmed 2026-09-27:
  a direct push is refused at the tool level regardless of how minor or
  independently-verified the change is (`a3a9571`'s own "straight to
  main" pattern predates that correction and is superseded, not a
  precedent to repeat). Conventional-commit format,
  `Co-Authored-By: Claude Sonnet 5 <noreply@anthropic.com>`, push the
  branch, `gh pr create`, and report the URL. Then `gh pr checks <n>`
  to confirm CI is actually green before calling it done, not just that
  `gh pr create` returned a link.

## Reporting shape

Match the established format: **novedades reales** (per item: what
changed, the link, what it means for Periplo), then **sin cambios**
(the rest of the list, one line), then **watch-items** with dates. A
sweep that finds nothing is still a valid report: say so, don't invent
movement. Respond in español mexicano (the user's standing preference).

## Current watch-items (update these as they resolve)

- `x402-foundation/x402#3338`, Periplo's settlement-override-ceiling
  fix PR. CI green, `BLOCKED`/`REVIEW_REQUIRED`. A direct nudge went out
  2026-09-15, no reply as of 2026-09-26. Next nudge no earlier than
  ~2026-09-29.
- `OpenZeppelin/stellar-contracts#868` ("Smart account: auth payload
  digest"), merged 2026-09-10 (`4529d708`, closes `#876`). Redefines the
  `Signer::Delegated` nested entry (an `AuthDigestPreimage` struct, not
  the raw digest) and confirms the 2026-09-02 raw-digest construction was
  wrong, but ships only in the unreleased `0.8.0` and adds no
  multi-`ContextRule` delegate test, so the two-context
  `UnvalidatedContext #3002` blocker stays open. Next trigger: the
  `0.8.0` crates.io release. Check
  `curl -s https://index.crates.io/st/el/stellar-accounts | tail -1`;
  when `0.8.0` appears, that is the go-ahead to bump the pin and re-run
  the two-context `settle()` (user decision 2026-09-10: wait for the
  release, do not pin a git rev). Full writeup in `docs/DEFERRED.md`
  Phase 6b watch-item.
- `OpenZeppelin/stellar-contracts#865`, Protocol 28 non-exhaustive
  `ContractExecutable` match: closed as completed 2026-09-26 via `#866`
  (fixed on `main`, which also moves the workspace to `soroban-sdk
  28.0.0`). No release published, so it rides on the same
  `stellar-accounts` `0.8.0` trigger as the `#868` item above. Nothing
  else to do.
- `stellar/js-stellar-sdk#1747`, the maintainer's own PR (`Closes
  #1655`, approved 2026-09-24, `CLEAN`). Periplo's `#1672` was closed
  unmerged in favor of it, and Periplo commented on `#1747` on
  2026-09-26 with the one case it misses (a signed `C...` node with an
  unsigned nested delegate, which Copilot raised inline first). Check for
  a reply and for the merge; `#1655` closes with it. `#1683`, `#1681`
  and `#1700` are closed, with fixes on `main` and not yet in a published
  `@stellar/stellar-sdk` release.
- `x402-foundation/x402#3138` (`mcp://` canonical-URL fix, LGTM'd twice
  since 2026-08-13). A direct nudge to `@phdargen` went out 2026-09-13.
  No maintainer reply as of 2026-09-26 (a commenter reaffirmed the LGTM
  on 2026-09-15). Next nudge threshold ~2026-09-27 (2 weeks
  out per the standing rule in step 3), don't nudge again before then.
- `OpenZeppelin/stellar-contracts#893` (docs-only follow-up to the
  closed `#840` finding, opened 2026-09-14, clarifies `collect_fee`'s
  `expiration_ledger` doc comment). Awaiting first maintainer review;
  no CI requirement beyond the repo's standard checks.
